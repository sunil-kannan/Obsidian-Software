# Dispatcher Servlet

>In Spring Boot, the `DispatcherServlet` plays a crucial role as the front controller for web applications. Here's a breakdown of its key functions:

### Centralized Request Handling:

- It receives all incoming HTTP requests and dispatches them to the appropriate controllers for processing.
- It acts as the entry point for all requests, managing the entire request-response lifecycle.

###  Handler Mapping:

- It uses handler mappings to determine which controller should handle a particular request based on the request URL and other factors.
- Spring Boot provides various handler mapping implementations, allowing flexibility in routing requests.

### Controller Execution:

- Once the appropriate controller is identified, the DispatcherServlet invokes its corresponding method to process the request and generate a response.
- It manages the interaction between controllers, views, and other components involved in request handling.

###  View Resolution:

- After the controller completes its processing, the DispatcherServlet uses view resolvers to determine the appropriate view to render the response.
- It supports various view technologies, such as JSP, Thymeleaf, and Freemarker.

###  Response Generation:

- Finally, the DispatcherServlet generates the response and sends it back to the client.

#### Auto-Configuration in Spring Boot:

- Spring Boot automatically configures the DispatcherServlet, eliminating the need for manual configuration in most cases.
- It registers the DispatcherServlet and maps it to the root URL path ("/") by default.

#### Customization:

- If needed, you can customize the DispatcherServlet's behavior using properties in the `application.properties` or `application.yaml` file.
- You can also create custom handler mappings, view resolvers, and other components to tailor the request handling process according to your requirements
