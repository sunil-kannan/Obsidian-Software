# Spring Boot over Spring

> Setting up Spring can be more complex and time-consuming compared to Spring Boot, requiring extensive configuration for each project.
> Spring development often involves numerous XML configurations, demanding developers to possess more extensive skills for project requirements.

## Main Features
### Dependency Management
Spring Boot packages necessary third-party dependencies into starter packages, tailored for different types of Spring-based applications. This simplifies dependency management for developers. No need of mentioning the dependency version, springboot will take care.

### Automatic Configuration
The framework automates configuration tasks, including those related to web projects, saving developers from manually specifying settings. While defaults may not always align with preferences, Spring Boot ensures an effective module for each specific task.

### Built-in Servlet Containers
Spring Boot provides built-in servlet containers, simplifying the application process. Developers can quickly create executable JAR files, and the framework takes care of the rest.


## Advantages

- Â Spring Boot eliminates the need for XML configuration and WAR file deployment, streamlining the development process.
- Spring Boot provides production ready tools that are easily customizable.
- Developers can focus on core business goals as Spring Boot eliminates boilerplate code
