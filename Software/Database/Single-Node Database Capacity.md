# Single-Node Database Capacity

> A blog is just like having a long conversation with people, so it should make sense that things you enjoy talking about will be closely related to your passion.

Single-Node Database Capacity Today:
Database	Max Writes/Sec (Optimized)	Hardware Needed
PostgreSQL	30,000-50,000	16+ cores, NVMe SSD
MySQL	25,000-40,000	16+ cores, NVMe SSD
Cassandra	100,000+	16+ cores, NVMe SSD
Redis (persistent)	100,000+	16+ cores, lots of RAM
