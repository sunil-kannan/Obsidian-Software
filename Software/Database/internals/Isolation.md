# Isolation

> There are four basic levels- _Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, and Serializable_ that provide different degrees of data protection


## 🔹 Example 1: Bank Transfer (Dirty Read)

### Scenario

- **T1** (Transaction 1) deducts ₹1000 from Account A but has **not committed yet**.
- **T2** (Transaction 2) reads Account A balance during this time.
### Behavior

- **READ_UNCOMMITTED** → T2 sees the **deducted balance** even though T1 hasn’t committed. (Dirty Read ❌)
- **READ_COMMITTED** → T2 only sees the balance after T1 commits. (Safe ✅)

👉 If T1 later rolls back, T2’s read in READ_UNCOMMITTED was **wrong**.

---

## 🔹 Example 2: Ticket Booking (Non-Repeatable Read)

### Scenario

- **T1** reads “Available tickets = 5”.
- **T2** books 2 tickets and commits.
- **T1** reads again → “Available tickets = 3”.
### Behavior

- **READ_COMMITTED** → T1 sees **different results** each time (Non-repeatable Read ❌).
- **REPEATABLE_READ** → T1 always sees “5 tickets” within its transaction (safe from non-repeatable reads ✅).

👉 But T1 might still miss that tickets went down in reality.

## 🔹 Example 3: Airline Booking (Phantom Read)

### Scenario

- **T1** checks for flights to “London” (finds 2 rows).
- **T2** adds a new London flight and commits.
- **T1** runs the same query again.
### Behavior

- **REPEATABLE_READ** → T1 may suddenly see **3 rows** (Phantom Read ❌).
- **SERIALIZABLE** → T1 is locked so T2 cannot insert until T1 finishes (no phantom ✅).

## ⚙️ Detailed Explanation

### 🔹 1. READ_COMMITTED 

- Each query in your transaction reads only **committed** data.
    
- But between two queries, data **might change** (non-repeatable read).
    
- When you commit, the DB doesn’t verify that what you read earlier is still the same.
    
- You’re responsible for rechecking before committing (for example, by verifying ticket count in code).
    

👉 So no final check — the DB just commits whatever you wrote last.

---

### 🔹 2. REPEATABLE_READ

- When you start the transaction, the DB gives you a **consistent snapshot** of all the rows you read.
    
- Another transaction (T2) can modify those rows, but your transaction (T1) still “sees” the old versions.
    
- When you **try to update**, the DB checks if that row has changed since your snapshot.
    
    - If yes → conflict → rollback or error.
        
    - If no → update succeeds.
        

So, the “check” happens **when you update**, not strictly at the very end.  
Still, it guarantees you don’t overwrite someone else’s committed change.

👉 So yes — there _is_ a form of validation before commit.

---

### 🔹 3. SERIALIZABLE

- This is the strictest one.
    
- The DB tracks _all_ the rows you **read** and **wrote** during the transaction.
    
- When you try to commit, it checks:
    
    > “Has any other transaction modified anything I depended on?”
    
- If yes → **serialization failure** (you must retry).
    
- This ensures transactions behave as if they happened one after another.
    

👉 Here, yes — the DB **absolutely checks at commit time** to guarantee consistency.
