# PgBouncer

> PgBouncer is a connection pooler for PostgreSQL that ==improves performance by managing and reusing database connections, especially under heavy traffic==. Instead of creating a new connection for every request, which is resource-intensive for PostgreSQL, PgBouncer acts as a lightweight proxy, allowing the database to handle more concurrent users efficiently. It significantly reduces the overhead of opening and closing connections, making applications more performant and scalable.
