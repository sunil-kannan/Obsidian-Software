# Cryptography

> Cryptography is a technique of securing information and communications using codes to ensure confidentiality, integrity and authentication. Thus, preventing unauthorized access to information. The prefix "crypt" means "hidden" and the suffix "graphy" means "writing". In Cryptography, the techniques that are used to protect information are obtained from mathematical concepts and a set of rule-based calculations known as algorithms to convert messages in ways that make it hard to decode them.
