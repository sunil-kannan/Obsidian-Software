# `git stash` is used to save your uncommitted changes temporarily so you can switch branches or work on something else without committing those changes.
git stash

# This command forcefully pushes your local branch to the remote branch, potentially overwriting any changes that have been made on the remote. Use with caution, as it can cause data loss if you're overwriting commits that other team members might need. Always coordinate with your team before using `-f` (force push).
git push origin <branch name> -f
