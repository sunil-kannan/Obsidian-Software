## Simple Interest (PTR / 100)

```c
Simple Interest = PTR / 100 
// P = Principal, R = Rate of Interest in % per annum, and T = Time
```


The rate of interest for the first 2 years is 3% per annum, for the next 3 years is 8% per annum, and for the period beyond 5 years is 10% per annum. If Rohan withdraws a total amount of Rs. 5000 after 7 years, find the sum(approx.) he deposited?

S.I. = S.I for 1 & 2 year + S.I. for 3, 4, & 5 year + S.I. for 6
S.I. = (P × R1 × T1) ÷ 100 + (P × R2 × T2) ÷ 100 + (P × R3 × T3) ÷ 100

Answer : 3333


## Compound Interest (A = P[1 +(R/100)]n)

**Find the compound interest (CI) on Rs. 12,600 for 2 years at 10% per annum compounded annually**

A = P[1 +(R/100)]n
A = = 12600[1 + (10/100)]2
Answer = 15426
