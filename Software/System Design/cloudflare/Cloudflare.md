## ☁️ What is Cloudflare?

**Cloudflare** is a **global cloud platform** that provides services to make websites and web applications **faster, more secure, and more reliable**.  

It sits **between users and your web server** — acting as a **reverse proxy**.  
So all user requests go through Cloudflare before reaching your origin server.

## ⚙️ Key Functions of Cloudflare

### 1. 🌍 Content Delivery Network (CDN)
- Cloudflare has **data centers worldwide**.
- It caches your static content (like images, CSS, JS) at those edge locations.
- When users visit your site, they get data from the **nearest Cloudflare server**, not your main server — making it **much faster**.

### 2. 🛡️ DDoS Protection & Web Security
- Cloudflare blocks **malicious traffic** such as:
  - DDoS attacks  
  - SQL injections  
  - Cross-site scripting (XSS)  
- It uses a **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** and **bot detection** to protect your site.

### 3. 🔒 SSL/TLS & HTTPS
- It automatically provides **free SSL certificates**.
- You can enable HTTPS easily, even if your origin server doesn’t support it.

### 4. 🚦 Load Balancing & Traffic Routing
- Cloudflare can distribute traffic across multiple servers or regions.
- Helps with **failover**, so if one server goes down, traffic shifts automatically.

### 5. ⚡ Performance Optimization
- Features like:
  - **Image compression**
  - **Caching**
  - **Code minification**
  - **HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 support**
- Improve your website’s loading speed and reduce bandwidth usage.

### 6. 🧩 DNS (Domain Name System)
- Cloudflare runs one of the **fastest DNS resolvers** in the world (1.1.1.1).
- Its DNS is known for being **secure, privacy-focused, and extremely fast**.
