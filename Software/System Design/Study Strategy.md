# Study Strategy

> A blog is just like having a long conversation with people, so it should make sense that things you enjoy talking about will be closely related to your passion.

## Phase 1: Foundation (1-2 months)
- Read "Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach"
- Simultaneously practice with Wireshark to see protocols in action
- Set up a simple proxy server to understand how they work

## Phase 2: Web Protocols (1 month)
- Read "HTTP: The Definitive Guide"
- Experiment with different HTTP versions using curl/browser tools
- Implement caching headers in a small web application

## Phase 3: System Design (2-3 months)
- Read "Designing Data-Intensive Applications"
- Practice designing systems on paper
- Study real-world architecture blogs (Netflix, Uber, Airbnb tech blogs)

## Phase 4: Integration & Practice
- Combine knowledge by designing complete systems
- Explain concepts to others (rubber duck debugging)
- Follow the "Backend Developer Roadmap" as a checklist

### Key Concepts to Master from Your List
As you study, ensure you understand:

HTTP: Versions (1.0, 1.1, 2, 3), methods, headers, status codes, cookies

Proxies: Forward vs reverse proxies, load balancing, SSL termination

CDNs: Caching strategies, edge computing, origin shielding

Networking: TCP vs UDP, DNS, TLS/SSL, latency vs bandwidth

Practical Projects to Reinforce Learning
Build a simple HTTP proxy from scratch

Implement caching strategies in a web app

Set up a CDN using Cloudflare or AWS CloudFront

Analyze network traffic with Wireshark

Design systems on paper (URL shortener, chat system, video platform)

The key is consistent, deliberate practice. Don't just readâ€”build things, break things, and understand why they break. This combination of theoretical knowledge and practical application will give you deep, lasting understanding of these fundamental concepts.
