## Key Concepts in Low-Level Design for Java Interviews

### 1. **Object-Oriented Design Principles**

- **Encapsulation**: Using private fields with getters/setters.
- **Inheritance**: Extending classes and using `super`.
- **Polymorphism**: Method overriding, interfaces, and abstract classes.
- **Abstraction**: Hiding internal details with interfaces/abstract classes.
- **SOLID Principles**:
    
    - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
        
    - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
        
    - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
        
    - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
        
    - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
        

### 2. **Design Patterns**

Be ready to apply or discuss common design patterns such as:

- Creational: Singleton, Factory, Builder
    
- Structural: Adapter, Decorator, Composite
    
- Behavioral: Strategy, Observer, Command
    

### 3. **Class Diagrams & Relationships**

- Understand how to create UML class diagrams.
    
- Show relationships like:
    
    - Association, Aggregation, Composition
        
    - Dependency
        
    - Inheritance (is-a)
        
    - Interface implementation (realization)
        

### 4. **Data Structures & Algorithms**

- Use appropriate data structures (List, Map, Set) based on design.
    
- Optimize with proper algorithmic choices when necessary.
    

### 5. **Concurrency Considerations (if relevant)**

- Thread safety, synchronization
    
- Immutable classes
    
- Java concurrency utilities (ExecutorService, Locks)
    

### 6. **Exception Handling and Validation**

- Use of checked vs unchecked exceptions.
    
- Proper input validation and error messages.
    

### 7. **Code Readability and Modularity**

- Clean, modular code with meaningful naming.
    
- Comments and JavaDocs where appropriate.
