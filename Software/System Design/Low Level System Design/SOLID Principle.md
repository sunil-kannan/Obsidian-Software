# SOLID Principle

> _SOLID_ is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design (OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin (also known as [Uncle Bob](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil_Martin)).


SOLID stands for:

- [**S** - Single-responsibility Principle](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual-articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design#single-responsibility-principle)
- [**O** - Open-closed Principle](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual-articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design#open-closed-principle)
- [**L** - Liskov Substitution Principle](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual-articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design#liskov-substitution-principle)
- [**I** - Interface Segregation Principle](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual-articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design#interface-segregation-principle)
- [**D** - Dependency Inversion Principle](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual-articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design#dependency-inversion-principle)

## Single-Responsibility Principle

Single-responsibility Principle (SRP) states:

> A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.



## Open-Closed Principle

Open-closed Principle (OCP) states:

> Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

This means that a class should be extendable without modifying the class itself.
