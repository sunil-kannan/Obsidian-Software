# SOLID Principle

> _SOLID_Â is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design (OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin (also known asÂ [Uncle Bob](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil_Martin)).


SOLID stands for:

- [**S**Â - Single-responsibility Principle](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual-articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design#single-responsibility-principle)
- [**O**Â - Open-closed Principle](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual-articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design#open-closed-principle)
- [**L**Â - Liskov Substitution Principle](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual-articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design#liskov-substitution-principle)
- [**I**Â - Interface Segregation Principle](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual-articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design#interface-segregation-principle)
- [**D**Â - Dependency Inversion Principle](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual-articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design#dependency-inversion-principle)

## Single-Responsibility Principle

Single-responsibility Principle (SRP) states:

> A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.



## Open-Closed Principle

Open-closed Principle (OCP) states:

> Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

This means that a class should be extendable without modifying the class itself.


## Liskov Substitution Principle

Liskov Substitution Principle states:

> Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.

This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.

## Interface Segregation Principle

The interface segregation principle states:

> A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesnâ€™t use, or clients shouldnâ€™t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

This principle emphasizes that large, general-purpose interfaces should be broken down into smaller, more specific ones. This way, client classes only need to know about the methods that are relevant to them.


## Dependency Inversion Principle

Dependency inversion principle states:

> Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.

This principle allows for decoupling.
