# 📊 Monitoring, Logging, and Tracing — Observability in Microservices

In modern distributed systems, **observability** is critical to understand system behavior. Observability typically relies on **Monitoring, Logging, and Tracing**.  

---

## 1️⃣ Logging

**Definition:** Logging is the practice of recording discrete events in your application.  

**Purpose:**  
- Debugging issues.  
- Audit and record-keeping.  
- Tracking application behavior over time.

**Characteristics:**  
- Usually **structured** (JSON, key-value pairs) or unstructured (plain text).  
- Logs can contain **contextual information**, e.g., request IDs, user IDs, timestamps.

**Tools:**  
- ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)  
- Loki + Grafana  
- Splunk

**Example:**
```
[2025-10-20 12:01:23] ERROR PaymentService - Payment failed for orderId=12345, userId=987
```

## 2️⃣ Monitoring

**Definition:** Monitoring continuously observes system **metrics** and **health signals**.  

**Purpose:**  
- Detect outages or performance degradation.  
- Alert teams when thresholds are crossed.  
- Track system trends over time.

**Metrics Examples:**  
- CPU, memory usage  
- Response time / latency  
- Request throughput  
- Error rate

**Tools:**  
- Prometheus + Grafana  
- Datadog, New Relic  
- CloudWatch

**Visualization:**  
- Dashboards show metrics over time.  
- Alerts can trigger notifications (Slack, PagerDuty).

## 3️⃣ Distributed Tracing

**Definition:** Tracing tracks **individual requests** as they propagate through multiple services.  

**Purpose:**  
- Measure latency per service.  
- Identify bottlenecks.  
- Debug failures in a distributed system.

**How It Works:**  
- Each request gets a **unique trace ID**.  
- Each service generates **spans** for operations.  
- Trace and span IDs propagate across services (via HTTP headers or gRPC metadata).  
- Tracing backend reconstructs the **request path**.

**Example Tools:**  
- Jaeger  
- Zipkin  
- OpenTelemetry

**Headers Example (B3 format):**
```
X-B3-TraceId: 463ac35c9f6413ad48485a3953bb6124  
X-B3-SpanId: a2fb4a1d1a96d312  
X-B3-ParentSpanId: 0020000000000001
```

## 4️⃣ Comparison

| Aspect | Logging | Monitoring | Tracing |
|--------|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Scope** | Individual events | Metrics over time | Entire request journey |
| **Goal** | Debugging & audit | Health & alerts | Performance & bottlenecks |
| **Data Type** | Logs (text, JSON) | Metrics (numeric) | Trace IDs & spans |
| **Time** | Discrete events | Continuous | Continuous per request |
| **Tools** | ELK, Loki | Prometheus, Datadog | Jaeger, Zipkin, OpenTelemetry |

## 5️⃣ How They Work Together

- **Monitoring** tells you *something is wrong*.  
- **Tracing** shows *where in the system the problem occurs*.  
- **Logging** provides *detailed context for the problem*.  

**Example Flow:**  
1. Prometheus detects high latency → triggers alert.  
2. Jaeger shows Service B is slow → tracing highlights the bottleneck.  
3. ELK logs provide exact error messages → root cause found.

---

## 6️⃣ Summary

- **Logging:** Record discrete events.  
- **Monitoring:** Observe metrics & system health.  
- **Tracing:** Track requests across services.  

> Observability = Monitoring + Logging + Tracing → gives full insight into distributed systems.
