- Transport layer
- Network layer
- Data link layer
- Physical layer 

## 7 layer model

- Presentation layer - encoding, decoding 
- Session layer - connection establishing. This session layer present only in TCP connection and not in UDP which is Stateless, does not maintain session
- Transport layer - Reliable data transfer using ports and protocols like TCP or UDP
- Network layer - IP address (resolves the deviceâ€™s IP (e.g., 192.168.1.50), and sends the data packet.)
- Data link layer - The IP address is resolved to the device's **MAC address** using **ARP**
- Physical layer - wifi or fiber (data transmission)
