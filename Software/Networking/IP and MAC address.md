# IP and MAC address

> A blog is just like having a long conversation with people, so it should make sense that things you enjoy talking about will be closely related to your passion.



## Private IP Address 
**Private IPs** (like `192.168.x.x`) are **non-routable** on the public internet. They're reserved for **local use within a private network**, such as your home, office, or data center.

## MAC address
MAC addresses are unique to every network-enabled device. They are unique due to a standardized format and assignment process managed by the IEEE. The IEEE assigns MAC addresses to manufacturers, who embed them in devices during production.
