# STUN

> A STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) server is ==a tool that helps devices behind a firewall or Network Address Translator (NAT) discover their public IP address and port==. This is crucial for establishing direct peer-to-peer (P2P) connections in applications like VoIP and WebRTC, allowing devices to communicate directly with each other without needing a central relay server to forward their traffic. The client sends a request to the STUN server, which responds with the public IP address and port it sees the client coming from.
