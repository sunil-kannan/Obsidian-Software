# Peer to Peer Communication

> The P2P process deals with a network structure where any participant in the network known as a node acts as both a client and a server. This means that, rather than relying on a basis server to supply resources or services, everybody from the network of nodes can trade resources and services with one another. In a P2P system, every node has an equal role to play and the same functionalities, which means that the loads are well shared.
