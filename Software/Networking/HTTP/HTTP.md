# HTTP

> **HTTP** is a [protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Protocol) for fetching resources such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser. A complete document is typically constructed from resources such as text content, layout instructions, images, videos, scripts, and more.
