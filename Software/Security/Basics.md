# Basics

> Security breach is inevitable when comes to software.


“Uncle Milton Industries has been selling ant farms to children since 1956. Some years ago, I remember opening one up with a friend. There were no actual ants included in the box. Instead, there was a card that you filled in with your address, and the company would mail you some ants. My friend expressed surprise that you could get ants sent to you in the mail. [Bruce Schneier] replied: ‘What's really interesting is that these people will send a tube of live ants to anyone you tell them to.’ … Security requires a particular mindset. Security professionals -- at least the good ones -- see the world differently. They can't walk into a store without noticing how they might shoplift. They can't use a computer without wondering about the security vulnerabilities. They can't vote without trying to figure out how to vote twice.”

## CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)
CVE, which stands for **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures**, is a dictionary that provides a standardized way to identify and describe publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities and exposures. It's a list of entries, each assigned a unique CVE ID, and includes a description of the vulnerability, at least one public reference, and the product and version affected.
