## SSH (Secure Shell)

- SSH, or Secure Shell, isÂ ==a network protocol that allows users to establish secure remote connections over an unsecured network==.
- The SSH protocol uses strong encryption to avoid this and the OpenSSH daemon is built carefully to avoid security bugs as much as possible
- Until SSH, something called telnet was the standard. telnet was highly insecure as it did not encrypt communication between you and the server you were connecting to.
