# Jenkins CLI

> Jenkins CLI Setup and Usage. My Jenkins is running on port 8989.

### Step 1: Download Jenkins CLI Jar

1. Go to [http://localhost:8989/manage/cli/](http://localhost:8989/manage/cli/) and download the `jenkins-cli.jar` file.
   
### Step 2: Create a New API Token

1. Visit [http://localhost:8989/user/sunil/configure](http://localhost:8989/user/sunil/configure).
2. Create a new API token.
3. Copy the API token for later use.

### Step 3: Run Jenkins CLI Command

1. Navigate to the folder where you downloaded `jenkins-cli.jar`.
2. Use the following command to authenticate and check the available commands:

```bash

java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -noCertificateCheck -s http://192.168.11.192:8989/ -auth sunil:116eb332774e1255cb2814fac416879683
```
### Step 4: Create batch file

You can create an alias for the Jenkins CLI command in Windows to shorten the typing process. Since Windows doesnâ€™t support native command aliases like Linux, you can achieve this using batch files.
- **Create a Batch File**:
    
    - Open **Notepad** or any text editor.
        
    - Add the following content:
        `@echo off java -jar C:\path\to\jenkins-cli.jar -noCertificateCheck -s http://192.168.11.192:8989/ -auth sunil:116eb332774e1255cb2814fac416879683 %*`
        
    - Replace `C:\path\to\jenkins-cli.jar` with the actual path where your `jenkins-cli.jar` file is located.
        
- **Save the Batch File**:
    
    - Save the file as `jenkins.bat`.
    - Save it in a directory that's included in your **PATH** environment variable (e.g., `C:\Windows\` or any other directory added to the PATH).
    - Make sure that you have added the path in the **PATH** environment variable and it should be in the 'C' folder.
    
- Run the command to check
	```bash
	jenkins who-am-i
	# Authenticated as: sunil
	# Authorities:
	# authenticated
```
